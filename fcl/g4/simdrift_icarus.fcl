# Standard configuration for the SimDriftElectrons module
#
# Use the SimEnergyDeposits from IonAndScint withouth
# the space-charge offsets are applied. These offsets
# are then applied in the SimDriftElectrons itself.
# Note that the "priorSCE" SimEnergyDeposits, while they
# don't include space-charge offsets, they still
# include space-charge e-field corrections (I know...)

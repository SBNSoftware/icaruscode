# File:    simulation_genie_icarus_bnb_volDetEnclosure.fcl
# Purpose: generate neutrino interactions from BNB in the whole DetEnclosure volume
# Date:    January 11, 2021
# Author:  Gianluca Petrillo (petrillo@slac.stanford.edu)
# 
# This configuration is based on `simulation_genie_icarus_bnb.fcl`,
# the only difference being that the generation volume is explicitly
# specified to be the detector enclosure, that is a box including
# all cryostats.

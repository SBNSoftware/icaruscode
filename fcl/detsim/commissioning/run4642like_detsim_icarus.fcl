# Purpose: Simulation of digitization with parameters mirroring data run 4642.
# Author:  Gianluca Petrillo (petrillo@slac.stanford.edu)
# Date:    February 5, 2021
#
# This job configuration is designed to replicate the conditions of an actual
# commissionin run.
# Many of the runs have features documented in the spreadsheet at
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VabkSa9ogYl8pkoGGjin9DLpe3lCVOsfQtgKX4QrutM
#
# Note that the timestamp of the event is not replicating the one of the run,
# since it has already been assigned at generation step.

# Run 4642
# =========
# 
# Beam:       BNB, 3 Hz, 2.8 10^12 POT/spill
# Detectors:  East PMT only, and trigger
# Trigger:    minimum bias
# PMT window: single, -50 us -- +50 us around the trigger signal

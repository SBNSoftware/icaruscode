# File:    photpropservices_icarus.fcl
# Purpose: Configuration of services related to the optical detectors.
#
# Currently provides:
# * `icarus_photonvisibilityservice_direct`: configuration of
#     `PhotonVisibilityService` using a photon visibility library and no mapping
# * `icarus_photonvisibilityservice_mapped`: configuration of
#     `PhotonVisibilityService` using a single cryostat photon visibility
#     library and a mapping
# * `icarus_photonvisibilityservice_mapped_oldPMTmap`: configuration of
#     `PhotonVisibilityService` using a single cryostat photon visibility
#     library and a library mapping, for use with the old PMT channel mapping
# * `icarus_photonvisibilityservice`: default configuration of
#     `PhotonVisibilityService` used in higher level standard scripts

###  Configuration for first cryostat library and mapping to the other one

# This is the configuration expected to work correctly with the current version
# of the software.
# 
# This configuration is used for:
#  * OLD photon visibility library (20180801)
#  * NEW PMT channel mapping
# Since that library was compiled with the old PMT channel mapping, when using
# the new mapping a channel remapping is required.

    # it now should be associated to channel CryostatChannelRemap[c] instead

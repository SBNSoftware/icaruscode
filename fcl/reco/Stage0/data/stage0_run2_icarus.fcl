# Drop the artdaq format files on output,

# Drop all output from the 1D deconvolution stage
# Drop the recob::Wire output from the roifinder (but keep the ChannelROIs)
# Drop the reconstructed optical hits before the timing correction
# Drop the PMT waveforms (will keep the ones from daqPMTonbeam)
# Keep the Trigger fragment

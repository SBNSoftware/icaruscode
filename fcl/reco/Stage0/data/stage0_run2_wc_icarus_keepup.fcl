## This fhicl file is used to run "stage0" processing specifically for the case where all
## TPC data is included in an artdaq data product from a single instance

#include "stage0_run2_wc_icarus.fcl"

## Add the purity monitor
physics.outana:        [ purityinfoana0, purityinfoana1 ]
physics.trigger_paths: [ path ]
physics.end_paths:     [ outana, streamROOT ]


## Need overrides for the purity monitor
physics.analyzers.purityinfoana0.SelectEvents: [ path ]
physics.analyzers.purityinfoana1.SelectEvents: [ path ]

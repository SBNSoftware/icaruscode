#
# Purpose: Processes generated Monte Carlo events through GEANT4 detector simulation
# 
# 
# Input
# ------
# 
# * all `simb::MCTruth` collection data products are used as input
# 
# 
# Output
# -------
# 
# * `largeant` ("legacy" `LArG4` module):
#     * `simb::MCParticle` collection: all initial, intermediate and final
#       particles propagated through the detector (exceptions apply)
#     * `sim::SimEnergyDeposit` collections: `TPCActive` and `Others`
#     * `sim::SimChannel` collection: ionisation drifted to TPC channels
#     * `sim::SimPhoton` collection: scintillation photons converting into PMT
#     * `sim::AuxDetSimChannel` collection: hits from auxiliary detectors (CRT)

# Purpose: Configuration drop in to use the no-overburden geometry.

# Version: 1.1
# 
# Usage
# ======
# 
# Include this header after the configuration of the services in your main job
# configuration file.
# The geometry service must have already been configured at that point, and
# the file `geometry_icarus.fcl` must have already been included.
# 
# Example: transform `standard_g4_icarus.fcl` in a no-overburden version:
#     
#     #include "standard_g4_icarus.fcl"
#     
#     # turn to no-overburden geometry:
#     #include "use_no_overburden_geometry_icarus.fcl"
#     
# 
# Changes:
# 20200219 (petrillo@slac.stanford.edu) [v1.0]
#   original version
# 20201004 (petrillo@slac.stanford.edu) [v1.1]
#   updated to split wire geometry
# 

#
# override the geometry configuration with the one
# `icarus_split_induction_no_overburden_geometry_services`
# defined in `geometry_icarus.fcl` (which must have been already included)

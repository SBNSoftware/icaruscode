/**
 * @brief Helper class to produce plots about trigger simulation and trigger
 *        efficiency.
 * @see icarus::trigger::MajorityTriggerEfficiencyPlots
 * 
 * This helper class provides the foundation for writing a module producing sets
 * of plots based on trigger primitives given in input.
 * 
 * The following documentation mainly deals with the most standard configuration
 * and operations in ICARUS. Modules made with this helper and the modules
 * upstream of them in data processing have quite some knobs that can be
 * manipulated to test unorthodox configurations.
 * 
 * An example of module implemented with this class is
 * `icarus::trigger::MajorityTriggerEfficiencyPlots`.
 * 
 * 
 * Overview of trigger simulation steps
 * =====================================
 * 
 * This simulation only trigger primitives derived from the optical detector
 * via hardware (V1730B boards).
 * The trigger simulation branches from the standard simulation of optical
 * detector waveforms (`icarus::SimPMTIcarus` module).
 * From there, multiple steps are needed.
 * 
 * 1. Produce single-PMT-channel discriminated waveforms: the discrimination
 *    threshold can be chosen ("ADC threshold" or just "threshold" in the
 *    following), and the result is one binary discriminated waveform that
 *    has value `0` when the waveform is under threshold and `1` when it's
 *    above threshold, with the same time discretization as the PMT waveform.
 *    Each discriminated waveform spans the whole event readout time and
 *    therefore it may merge information from multiple readout waveforms
 *    (`raw::OpDetWaveform`), but all from the same optical detector channel.
 *    This step can be performed with the module
 *    `icarus::trigger::DiscriminatePMTwaveforms`.
 * 2. Combine the discriminated waveforms in pairs, in the same fashion as the
 *    V1730B readout board does to produce LVDS output. The output of this step
 *    is roughly half as many discriminated outputs as there were from the
 *    previous step (some channels are not paired). This output will be called
 *    _trigger primitives_ because it is what the trigger logics is based on.
 *    We say that a trigger primitive is "on" when its level is `1`.
 *    This step can be performed with the module `icarus::trigger::LVDSgates`.
 * 3. Simulate the trigger logic based on the trigger primitives _(see below)_.
 *    This usually includes the requirement of coincidence with the beam gate.
 * 
 * Trigger logic may be complex, being implemented in a FPGA.
 * Many options are available, including:
 * 
 * * coincidence of a minimum number of trigger primitives: the event is trigger
 *   if at least _N_ trigger primitives are on at the same time;
 * * sliding window: primitives are grouped depending on their location, and
 *   there is a requirement on the minimum number of primitives in "on" level
 *   within one or more of these groups. For example, any sliding window of 30
 *   channels (corresponding to 16 trigger primitives in standard ICARUS PMT
 *   readout installation) has to contain at least 10 trigger primitives "on"
 *   at the same time; or there must be two sliding windows with that condition;
 *   etc. Sliding windows can be obtained from further processing of the LVDS
 *   trigger primitives, for example with the module
 *   `icarus::trigger::SlidingWindowTrigger`.
 * 
 * This class is expected to support modules implementing different trigger
 * logics.
 * 
 * 
 * Data objects for discriminated waveforms
 * -----------------------------------------
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_Data
 *
 * A discriminated waveform is the information whether the level of a waveform
 * is beyond threshold, as function of time.
 * A discriminated waveform may be binary, i.e. with only levels `0` and `1`
 * based on a single threshold, or with multiple levels.
 * Also the numerical _addition_ of two binary discriminated waveforms
 * yields a multi-level waveform (in fact, three levels -- `0`, `1` and `2`).
 * 
 * We represent this data in the forms of "events": an event is a change of
 * level happening at a certain time. The class holding this information,
 * `icarus::trigger::TriggerGateData`, covers the whole time, starting with a
 * ground level `0`. The next event will be a "opening" that increases the
 * level, usually to `1`. Other changing events may follow, and typically the
 * last one will bring the level back to `0`.
 * 
 * This information is joined by a list of _channel numbers_ in order to
 * represent a discriminated waveform e.g. from the optical detector.
 * There may be one or more channels associated to a discriminated waveform,
 * but for us there should always be at least one.
 * The discriminated waveforms from PMT readout (`raw::OpDetWaveform`) are
 * associated to a single channel, while LVDS trigger primitives are most often
 * associated to two channels (some channels are not paired and will have only
 * one channel). A sliding window will have as many channels as the PMT it
 * covers. The global trigger should have _all_ channels, while in ICARUS each
 * of the two discriminated wabeforms from a cryostat should have half the
 * channels.
 * This information is represented in the class
 * `icarus::trigger::ReadoutTriggerGate`, which inherits from
 * `icarus::trigger::TriggerGateData`.
 * This class is generic and can hold any representation for the time of the
 * level changing events, for the levels, and for the identifiers of the
 * channels. ICARUS specifies a data type for each of these quantities, and
 * the resulting `icarus::trigger::ReadoutTriggerGate` class instance is called
 * `icarus::trigger::OpticalTriggerGateData_t`.
 * 
 * @note The class `icarus::trigger::OpticalTriggerGateData_t` is the one that
 *       gets written to disk in the _art_ ROOT files.
 *       That is not a class by itself, but rather an alias of
 *       `icarus::trigger::ReadoutTriggerGate`, and many coding tools will call
 *       it in the latter way.
 * 
 * It is often convenient to track for each trigger gate object which input
 * contributed to it, both in terms of channels and of single waveforms.
 * The list of channels is embedded in `icarus::trigger::ReadoutTriggerGate`,
 * while the list of source waveforms is not. An additional wrapper object,
 * `icarus::trigger::TrackedOpticalTriggerGate`, contains a trigger gate proper
 * (`icarus::trigger::ReadoutTriggerGate`) and a list of pointers to the source
 * waveforms. In most of the code the source is represented by metadata
 * (`sbn::OpDetWaveformMeta`) rather than the full waveforms
 * (`raw::OpDetWaveform`) so that the bulk of the data is not necessary for the
 * vast majority of the uses, and it can be dropped.
 * 
 * Utilities are available to manage the serialization of
 * `icarus::trigger::TrackedOpticalTriggerGate` objects
 * (`icaruscode/PMT/Trigger/Utilities/TriggerDataUtils.h`), which is implemented
 * as a trigger gate collection and a association object
 * 
 * There are utilities available in
 * `icaruscode/PMT/Trigger/Utilities/TriggerDataUtils.h` that can convert them
 * into a collection of `icarus::trigger::OpticalTriggerGateData_t` objects
 * plus a collection of _art_ associations (for writing), and the other way
 * around (for reading). Additional utilities allow to bridge between
 * the waveform metadata and their original waveforms
 * (`icaruscode/PMT/Trigger/Utilities/OpDetWaveformMetaMatcher.h`), which is
 * needed when a producer utilising the metadata and combining trigger gates
 * wants to save associations not only of the gates with the metadata,
 * but also with the original waveforms. The module `icarus::trigger::LVDSgates`
 * uses all of them and can be used as an illustration of the functionality.
 * 
 * A module is provided, called `icarus::trigger::DumpTriggerGateData`, which
 * dumps on screen or on text file the information from a collection of
 * discriminated waveforms in a (sort-of) human readable format.
 * An example configuration for this module is provided in `icaruscode`, called
 * `dump_triggergatedata_icarus.fcl`.
 * 
 * The main functions to manipulate the trigger gates are defined in the very
 * base class, `icarus::trigger::TriggerGateData`: these allow e.g. to find
 * events and query the level at a given time.
 * Another important set of features is also present in
 * `icarus::trigger::TriggerGateData` and replicated in the higher levels:
 * the combination of trigger gates by sum (`OR`), multiplication (_AND_),
 * minimum and maximum value.
 * 
 * @note Combining a multi-level gate via `Min()` with a binary gate results
 *       into a binary gate which is logic AND of the two gates.
 * 
 * 
 * On the terminology
 * -------------------
 * 
 * In this documentation, the "discriminated waveforms" are sometimes called
 * "trigger gates" and sometimes "trigger primitives".
 * Although these concepts are, strictly, different, usually the difference
 * does not affect the meaning and they end up being exchanged carelessly.
 * 
 * 
 * Trigger logic algorithm
 * ========================
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_Algorithm
 * 
 * The trigger logic algorithm is completely absent from this helper, and it is
 * entirely delegated to the derived classes (`simulateAndPlot()`). There are
 * nevertheless a lot of functions that may help to process the input trigger
 * primitives and fill some standard plots. Many of them are listed in the
 * documentation of `simulateAndPlot()`.
 * 
 * 
 * Event categories
 * =================
 * 
 * Each event is assigned to a set of categories, and its information
 * contributes to the plots of all those categories.
 * The categories are passed to the helper in the `initializePlots()` call to
 * create all the plots to be filled later.
 * A default list of categories is provided as `DefaultPlotCategories`.
 * 
 * 
 * Module usage
 * =============
 * 
 * The following aspects are common to all modules based on this helper.
 * 
 * 
 * Input data products
 * --------------------
 * 
 * This module uses the following data products as input:
 * 
 * * trigger primitives:
 *     * `std::vector<icarus::trigger::OpticalTriggerGateData_t>` (labels out of
 *       `TriggerGatesTag` and `Thresholds`): full sets of discriminated
 *       waveforms, each waveform possibly covering multiple optical channels,
 *       and their associations to optical waveforms. One set per threshold;
 *       note that these are converted into `InputTriggerGate_t` data type for
 *       internal use;
 *     * associations with `raw::OpDetWaveform` (currently superfluous);
 * * event characterization:
 *     * `std::vector<simb::MCTruth>`: generator information (from
 *       `GeneratorTags`; multiple generators are allowed at the same time);
 *       it is used mostly to categorize the type of event (background,
 *       weak charged current, electron neutrino, etc.);
 *     * `std::vector<simb::MCParticle>`: particles propagating in the detector
 *       (from `PropagatedParticles`); currently not used;
 *     * `std::vector<sim::SimEnergyDeposit>`: energy deposited in the active
 *       liquid argon volume (from `EnergyDepositTags`); it is used to
 *       quantify the energy available to be detected in the event.
 * 
 * 
 * Output plots
 * -------------
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_Plots
 * 
 * The module produces a standard set of plots for each configured ADC threshold
 * and for each event category.
 * The plots are saved via _art_ service `TFileService` in a ROOT file and they
 * are organized in nested ROOT directories under the module label directory
 * which is assigned by _art_:
 * 
 * * `Thr###` (outer level) describes the ADC threshold on the discriminated
 *   waveforms: the threshold is `###` from the baseline;
 * * `\<Category\>` (inner level) describes the category of events included in
 *   the plots (e.g. `All`, `NuCC`; see `PlotCategories`).
 * 
 * Each of the inner ROOT directories contains a full set of plots, whose name
 * is the standard plot name followed by its event category and threshold
 * (e.g. `Eff_NuCC_Thr15` for the trigger efficiency plot on neutrino charged
 * current events with 15 ADC counts as PMT threshold).
 * 
 * Each set of plots, defined in
 * `icarus::trigger::TriggerEfficiencyPlots::initializePlotSet()`
 * (and, within, `initializeEventPlots()`
 * and `initializeEfficiencyPerTriggerPlots()`), is contributed only by the
 * events in the set category.
 * 
 * There are different "types" of plots. Some
 * @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_SelectionPlots "do not depend on triggering at all",
 * like the deposited energy distribution. Others
 * @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_MultiTriggerPlots "cross different trigger definitions",
 * like the trigger efficiency as function of trigger requirement. Others still
 * @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_SingleTriggerPlots "assume a single trigger definition":
 * this is the case of trigger efficiency plots versus energy. Finally, there are
 * @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_SingleTriggerResponsePlots "plots that depend on a specific trigger definition and outcome":
 * this is the case of all the plots including only triggering or non-triggering
 * events.
 * 
 * A list of plots follows for each plot type.
 * All the plots are always relative to a specific optical detector channel
 * threshold (ADC) and a broad event category.
 * 
 * 
 * ### Plots independent of the triggers (including selection plots)
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_SelectionPlots
 * 
 * These plots are stored directly in a threshold/category folder:
 * 
 * * `EnergyInSpill`: total energy deposited in the detector during the time the
 *   beam gate is open. It is proportional to the amount of scintillation light
 *   in the event;
 * * `EnergyInSpillActive`: energy deposited in the active volume of the
 *   detector during the time the beam gate is open; the active volume is
 *   defined as the union of all TPC drift voulmes;
 * * plots specific to neutrino interactions (if the event is not a neutrino
 *   interaction, it will not contribute to them); if not otherwise specified,
 *   only the first neutrino interaction in the event is considered:
 *     * `InteractionType`: code of the interaction type, as in
 *       `sim::TruthInteractionTypeName`;
 *     * `NeutrinoEnergy`: generated energy of the interacting neutrino;
 *     * `LeptonEnergy`: generated energy of the lepton out of the _first_
 *       neutrino interaction;
 *     * `InteractionVertexYZ`: coordinates of the location of all interactions
 *       in the event, in world coordinates, projected on the anode plane.
 * * `ActivePMT`: the channels contributing to the trigger; a channel is added
 *   to this plot if it belongs to a gate (LVDS output) which during the beam
 *   gate it is beyond threshold at least once (note that in case of LVDS OR
 *   combination, a channel will appear in this plot even if it is not beyond
 *   threshold if the one paired with it is beyond threshold);
 *   this plot depends on the discrimination threshold.
 * 
 * 
 * @note In fact, these plots _usually_ do not even depend on the ADC threshold
 *       of the optical detector channels. Nevertheless, they are stored in the
 *       folders under specific thresholds, and they are duplicate.
 * 
 * 
 * ### Plots including different trigger requirements
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_MultiTriggerPlots
 * 
 * These plots collect information from scenarios with different trigger
 * requirements, but still with the same underlying optical detector channel
 * ADC threshold.
 * No plots are provided in this category by `TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase` at
 * the moment. Implementing modules can add plots by overriding the method
 * `initializePlotSet()`:
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
 * void MyTriggerEfficiencyPlots::initializePlotSet
 *   (PlotSandbox& plots, std::vector<SettingsInfo_t> const& settings) const
 * {
 *   // (inherited)
 *   helper().TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase::initializePlotSet(plots, settings);
 *   
 *   // ... add more plot definitions, e.g.
 *   plots.make<TEfficiency>(
 *     "Eff",
 *     "Efficiency of triggering;requested primitives;trigger efficiency",
 *     settings.size(), 0, settings.size()
 *     );
 *   
 * } // MyTriggerEfficiencyPlots::initializePlotSet()
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * 
 * 
 * ### Plots depending on a specific trigger definition
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_SingleTriggerPlots
 * 
 * The following plots depend on the full definition of the trigger, including
 * PMT thresholds _and_ other requirements.
 * They are hosted each in a subfolder of the threshold/category folder, with
 * a name encoding the requirement: `ReqXX` for trigger with minimum required
 * primitives `XX`.
 * 
 * * `EffVsEnergyInSpill`: trigger efficiency as function of the total energy
 *   deposited during the beam gate.
 * * `EffVsEnergyInSpillActive`: trigger efficiency as function of the energy
 *   deposited in the TPC active volumes during the beam gate.
 * * `EffVsNeutrinoEnergy`, `EffVsLeptonEnergy`: trigger efficiency as function
 *   of the true energy of the first interacting neutrino, and of the outgoing
 *   lepton in the final state of the interaction, respectively.
 * * `TriggerTick`: time of the earliest trigger, in ticks. Only triggering
 *   events contribute.
 * * `TriggerTime`: the time (relative to the nominal beam gate opening) of the
 *   "main" trigger (the earliest in the triggering window). Only triggering
 *   events contribute.
 * * `OpeningTimes`: the time (relative to the nominal beam gate opening) of
 *   all the times the trigger requirements were satisfied (limited to the
 *   time interval where the trigger emulation is performed). Only triggering
 *   events contribute.
 * 
 * The parameters are defined in the same way as in the
 * @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_SelectionPlots "selection plots", unless stated
 * otherwise.
 *
 *
 * ### Plots depending on a specific trigger definition and response
 *
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_SingleTriggerResponsePlots
 *
 * These plots depend on the trigger definition, as the ones in the previous
 * type, and on the actual trigger response.
 * They are hosted each in a subfolder of the threshold/category/requirement
 * folder, with a name encoding the response: `triggering` for triggering
 * events, `nontriggering` for the others.
 * 
 * Their event pool is filtered to include only the events in the current

 * 
 * Configuration parameters
 * =========================
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_Configuration
 * 
 * A terse description of the parameters is printed by running
 * `lar --print-description TriggerEfficiencyPlots`.
 * 
 * * `TriggerGatesTag` (string, mandatory): name of the module
 *     instance which produced the trigger primitives to be used as input;
 *     it must not include any instance name, as the instance names will be
 *     automatically added from `Thresholds` parameter.
 *     The typical trigger primitives used as input may be LVDS discriminated
 *     output (e.g. from `icarus::trigger::LVDSgates` module) or combinations
 *     of them (e.g. from `icarus::trigger::SlidingWindowTrigger` module).
 * * `Thresholds` (list of tags, mandatory): list of the discrimination
 *     thresholds to consider. A data product containing a
 *     digital signal is read for each one of the thresholds, and the tag of the
 *     data product is expected to be the module label `TriggerGatesTag` with as
 *     instance name the value of the threshold (e.g. for a threshold of `"60"`
 *     ADC counts the data product tag might be `LVDSgates:60`).
 * * `GeneratorTags` (list of input tags, default: `[ generator ]`): a list of
 *     data products containing the particles generated by event generators;
 *     if empty, plots or categories requiring truth information will be
 *     omitted;
 * * `DetectorParticleTag` (input tag, default: `largeant`): data product
 *     containing the list of particles going through the argon in the detector;
 * * `EnergyDepositTags`
 *     (list of input tags, default: `[ "largeant:TPCActive" ]`): a list of
 *     data products with energy depositions; if empty, plots or categories
 *     requiring energy deposition information will be omitted; in alternative,
 *     `EnergyDepositSummaryTag` can be specified with the same purpose;
 * * `EnergyDepositSummaryTag` (input tags, optional): if specified, overrides
 *     `EnergyDepositTags` and uses for the energy deposition the information
 *     from the summary in the specified data product; such summary may be
 *     created for example by `ExtractEnergyDepositionSummary` module;
 * * `BeamGateDuration` (time, _mandatory_): the duration of the beam
 *     gate; _the time requires the unit to be explicitly specified_: use
 *     `"1.6 us"` for BNB, `9.5 us` for NuMI (also available as
 *     `BNB_settings.spill_duration` and `NuMI_settings.spill_duration` in
 *     `trigger_icarus.fcl`);
 * * `BeamGateStart` (time, default: `0_us`): how long after the
 * *   @ref DetectorClocksBeamGateOpening "nominal beam gate opening time"
 *     the actual beam gate opens at;
 * * `PreSpillWindow` (time, default: `10_us`): a pre-spill window is defined
 *     to observe the activity before the beam gate that might leak into the
 *     latter; this parameter regulates how long that window last; its position
 *     can be tweaked with the `PreSpillWindowGap` parameter;
 * * `PreSpillWindowGap` (time, default: `0_us`): the delay from the _end_ of
 *     the pre-spill window and the start of the beam gate (`BeamGateStart`);
 *     by default, the pre-spill window immediately precedes the beam gate;
 *     negative values of the gap allow the pre-spill window to overlap
 *     (or to be after) the beam gate; the duration of the pre-spill window is
 *     set via `PreSpillWindow` parameter;
 * * `TriggerTimeResolution` (time, default: `8 ns`): time resolution for the
 *     trigger primitives;
 * * `EventTreeName` (optional string): if specified, a simple ROOT tree is
 *     created with the information from each event (see `EventInfoTree` for
 *     its structure);
 * * `EventDetailsLogCategory` (optional string): if specified, information for
 *     each single event is output into the specified stream category; if
 *     the string is specified empty, the default module stream is used, as
 *     determined by `LogCategory` parameter;
 * * `PlotOnlyActiveVolume` (flag, default: `true`): if set, only events within
 *     TPC active volume are plot; the check is performed on the generated
 *     location of the neutrino interactions (if any); events with no neutrino
 *     interactions are always plotted;
 * * `LogCategory` (string, default `TriggerEfficiencyPlots`): name of category
 *     used to stream messages from this module into message facility.
 * 
 * An example job configuration is provided as `maketriggerplots_icarus.fcl`.
 * 
 * 
 * Technical description of the module
 * ====================================
 * 
 * The modules based on this helper read
 * @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_Data "trigger gate data products" from
 * different ADC thresholds, and for each threshold they combine the data into a
 * trigger response depending on a ADC threshold.
 * Then they apply different trigger settings and for each one they fill plots.
 *
 * All the input sets (each with its own ADC treshold) are treated independently
 * from each other.
 * 
 * Each event is assigned to event categories. These categories do not depend on
 * trigger definition nor primitives. For example, a electron neutrino neutral
 * current interaction event would be assigned to the neutral current neutrino
 * interaction category, to the electron neutrino category, and so on.
 * A set of plot is produced at once for each of the event categories.
 *
 * This module is designed as follows:
 *
 * * each _art_ event is treated independently from the others (this is the
 *   norm; method: `process()`, to be called in module's `analyze()`);
 * * information for the plots which do not depend on the trigger primitives
 *   are extracted once per event (method: `extractEventInfo()`);
 * * the event is assigned its categories (method: `selectedPlotCategories()`,
 *   with the categories defined at the time of `initializePlots()` call);
 * * for each input primitive set (i.e. for each ADC threshold):
 *     * trigger logic is applied, the beam gate is imposed, a trigger result
 *       is extracted and plots are filled; all is done in the method
 *       `simulateAndPlot()` provided by the derived module.
 *
 * Note that the plots depending on the response may require multiple fillings.
 * For example, a trigger efficiency plot as function of the trigger settings
 * is a single plot in the plot set which requires a filling for every
 * trigger setting.
 * In a similar fashion, the plot of trigger time requires one filling for
 * each requirement level that is met.
 *
 *
 * Organization of the plots
 * --------------------------
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_OrganizationOfPlots
 *
 * Plots are written on disk via the standard _art_ service `TFileService`,
 * which puts them in a ROOT subdirectory named as the instance of this module
 * being run.
 *
 * As described above, there are two "dimensions" for the plot sets: there is
 * one plot set for each ADC threshold and for each event category, the total
 * number of plot sets being the product of the options in the two dimensions.
 *
 * The code is structured to work by threshold by threshold, because the trigger
 * response depends on the threshold but not by the event category: the response
 * is computed once per threshold, then all the plots related to that response
 * (including all the event categories) are filled.
 *
 * The structure in the file reflects this logic, and there are two levels of
 * ROOT directories inside the one assigned by _art_ to this module:
 * * the outer level pins down the ADC threshold of the plots inside it;
 *   the name of the directory follows the pattern `Thr###` (### being the ADC
 *   threshold), which is the "threshold tag";
 * * the inner level is the category of events included in the plots, and the
 *   name of the directories reflect the name of the category as defined in
 *   the corresponding `PlotCategory` object (`PlotCategory::name()`); this
 *   defines the "category tag".
 *
 * In each inner directory, a complete set of plots is contained.
 * The name of each plot is a base name for that plot (e.g. `Eff` for the
 * efficiency plot) with the event category tag and the threshold tag appended
 * (separated by an underscore character, `"_"`). The title of the plot is also
 * modified to include the description of the plot category (as defined in
 * `PlotCategory::description()`) and the ADC threshold.
 * Therefore, within the same module directory, all plot names are different.
 *
 *
 * Adding a plot
 * --------------
 *
 * When adding a plot, two actions are necessary:
 *
 * 1. initialize the new plot
 * 2. fill the new plot
 *
 * The initialization happens in
 * `icarus::trigger::TriggerEfficiencyPlots::initializePlotSet()` method.
 * A request must be issued to the
 * @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_PlotSandboxes "plot sandbox" to "make" the
 * plot.
 * In general it can be expected that all the arguments `args` in a call
 * `plots.make<PlotType>(args)` are forwarded to the constructor of `PlotType`,
 * so that to make a new `PlotType` object one has to consult only the
 * constructor of that class. Be aware though that the library expects the first
 * argument to be the ROOT name of the new object and the second to be its ROOT
 * title.
 * It is possible to work around this requirement with additional coding.
 *
 * The method performing the plotting is `simulateAndPlot()`.
 * The plots should be filled inside loops going through all plot sets.
 * The existing code already does that in two loops, one for the plots
 * depending on the trigger response requirement, and the other for the plots
 * _not_ depending on it.
 *
 *
 * ### About plot sandboxes
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_PlotSandboxes
 *
 * For the sake of this module, a plot sandbox is an object similar to a ROOT
 * `TDirectory`, which can mangle the objects it contains to change ("process")
 * their name and title, and that interacts properly with `art::TFileDirectory`
 * so make `TFileService` happy.
 * The processing of the name and title is used to add the category and
 * threshold tags to the plot ROOT name and the corresponding annotations to
 * the plot title, as described
 * @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_OrganizationOfPlots "above".
 *
 *
 * Adding an event category
 * -------------------------
 * 
 * @anchor TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_AddingCategory
 *
 * Event categories are specified to `initializePlots()` call: each category is
 * described by a simple object `PlotCategory` which contains a name (used in
 * ROOT directories, plot name tags and to univocally identify the category),
 * a description (used in plot titles) and a condition for the event to fulfill
 * in order to qualify for the category. The condition is a function object
 * that accepts an `EventInfo_t` object with the relevant event information,
 * and returns its decision (`true` if the event belongs to this category).
 *
 * To add a category, it is enough to add an entry in the collection of plot
 * categories passed to `initializePlots()`. The `DefaultPlotCategories` list
 * can be used as a starting point.
 *
 * The condition function adjudicates based on the information in `EventInfo_t`.
 * It is likely though that if a new category is needed, the information
 * currently available in `EventInfo_t` is not enough to decide the response.
 * In that case, `EventInfo_t` must be extended to hold the newly required
 * information. In addition, the method `extractEventInfo()` must be modified
 * to set the new information. The documentation of that method expands on this
 * topic.
 *
 *
 * Usage of the helper
 * ====================
 * 
 * An example of how to turn this helper class in a full blown _art_ module is
 * `icarus::trigger::MajorityTriggerEfficiencyPlots`.
 *
 *
 * Changing the trigger logic
 * ---------------------------
 *
 * The trigger logic is required to be coded in `simulateAndPlot()` of the
 * derived class. Some details on implementing it can be found in the
 * documentation of the method itself.
 *
 * To implement a trigger logic, several components need to be coordinated:
 *
 * 1. combination of trigger primitives;
 * 2. the data structure the combination is stored in;
 * 3. interpretation of that data structure in terms of trigger firing
 *    (which we call here "trigger settings");
 * 4. configuration of the trigger logic from user parameters.
 *
 * A module may simulate a trigger which counts the number of primitives that
 * are "on" and imposing a required minimum on that number for the trigger to
 * fire. This is a possible implementation including those elements:
 *
 * 1. combination of trigger primitives: primitives are summed into a single
 *    multilevel gate (with beam gate on top);
 * 2. the data structure the combination is stored in: a
 *    @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_Data "trigger gate object";
 * 3. interpretation of that data structure in terms of trigger firing:
 *    the logic requires a minimum number of primitives being on at the same
 *    time; the interpretation uses the level of the combined trigger gate as
 *    the number of primitives on at every time, and decides that the first
 *    time this number meets the requirement, the trigger fires;
 * 4. configuration of the trigger logic from user parameters:
 *    it's a parameter of the module itself (`MinimumPrimitives`).
 *
 * An example of how a different trigger logic could be implemented following
 * a similar model: let's assume we want a trigger based on two sliding windows.
 * A window is a group of LVDS signals from neighboring channels. We can split
 * the whole optical detector channels into many windows, and we can make the
 * windows overlap: for example, a window includes the first 30 channels behind
 * one anode plane, the second window includes 30 channels starting from the
 * fifteenth, the third window includes 30 channels starting from the thirtieth,
 * and so on. In ICARUS, 30 channels are served in 16 LVDS discriminated
 * waveforms, i.e. 16 trigger primitives. We may require as a loose trigger
 * that any window contains at least 10 primitives on at the same time (that is
 * about 20 PMT channels beyond ADC threshold), and as a tighter trigger that
 * there is a window with at least 8 trigger primitives on, _and_ the
 * corresponding window in the opposite TPC has at least 6 primitives on
 * at the same time. Note that a splitting 7/7 won't do: one of the two windows
 * must have 8 or more primitives on.
 * The input primitives from the point of view of the module now become the
 * "sliding window" combination of the LVDS trigger primitives, as produced e.g.
 * by `icarus::trigger::SlidingWindowTrigger` module.
 * How this can be implemented following the pattern of this module:
 *
 * 1. combination of trigger primitives: we prepare two primitives:
 *    one describes the maximum level among all the windows, and the other
 *    describes the level of the window opposite to the maximum (the way to
 *    achieve this is quite complicate);
 * 2. the data structure the combination is stored in: two
 *    @ref TriggerEfficiencyPlotsBase_Data "trigger gate objects";
 * 3. interpretation of that data structure in terms of trigger firing:
 *    for the loose trigger, we look for the first time the maximum window level
 *    reaches the designated threshold; for the tighter trigger, some
 *    additional logic is required, discriminating the maximum window level
 *    primitive to the higher threshold, the opposite window level on the lower
 *    threshold, and setting them in coincidence; then the time the resulting
 *    gate opens, if any, is the trigger time;
 * 4. configuration of trigger logic parameters: the two requirements (single
 *    window, double window with their minimum number of LVDS primitives)
 *    are read from the module FHiCL configuration; for computing efficiency,
 *    either in the constructor or in a `beginJob()` method we may also prepare
 *    the associations (pairing) between opposite windows or just channels;
 *
 * @todo add ability to discriminate a trigger gate object?
 *       discrimination on level _N_ (>=N -> 1, \<N -> 0) can be obtained with
 *       adding a _-N_ uniform level, flooring on level 0 and (if needed) maxing
 *       on level 1.
 *
 * 
 * Code style: quantities with units
 * ==================================
 * 
 * To avoid issues with missing or wrong conversions, this code often uses
 * LArSoft quantities library. A variable with a `Quantity` type is represented
 * with a specific unit (e.g. microseconds) and can undergo only limited
 * manipulation. The allowed manipulation should guarantee that the unit of
 * the quantity is correctly preserved. For example, it is not possible to
 * add to a `microseconds` interval a pure number (e.g. `9.0`), but rather
 * it is only possible to add time quantities (e.g. another `microseconds`
 * variable, or a `nanoseconds` variable, or a literal value with unit, like
 * `9.0_ns`), and those quantities are properly converted, with the caveat that
 * rounding errors may happen that a more careful explicit handling could avoid.
 * Also, there are two types of variables that can feature the same unit,
 * intervals and points. A point can't be scaled (e.g. you can't "double" the
 * time the beam gate opens, while you can double the beam gate _duration_)
 * and it can't be added to another point (the difference between two points
 * is an interval).
 * 
 * To avoid mistakes in the conversion between different time scales, the
 * LArSoft utility library `detinfo::DetectorTimings` is used, which is a
 * wrapper of `DetectorClocks` service provider that makes the interface to
 * convert times easier and uniform. Here we use it to convert time points
 * from the simulation (which are expressed in nanoseconds and are starting
 * at trigger time) into optical detector readout ticks, and vice versa.
 * The values returned by this library have encoded in them which time scale
 * they belong to, and in which unit they are measured.

  /**
   * @brief Simulates all triggers for a trigger setting and plots the results.
   * @param thresholdIndex the index of the PMT threshold of input primitives
   * @param gates the trigger primitives used to simulate the trigger response
   * @param eventInfo general information about the event being simulated
   * @param selectedPlots list of boxes containing plots to be filled
   * 
   * This pure virtual function is the core of the customization of this class.
   * The `simulateAndPlot()` method is expected to:
   * 
   * 1. combine the trigger primitives
   * 2. apply the beam gate
   * 3. generate the trigger response
   * 4. fill all plots
   * 
   * **for each trigger setting**.
   * Note that this helper class has no knowledge of those settings: how many
   * they are, what they mean, which are their parameters. It is
   * `simulateAndPlot()` task to properly process all of them _at once_, i.e.
   * within a single call.
   * 
   * Big deal! The second and fourth step (application of beam gate and plots
   * filling) have some helpers in this same class:
   * 
   * * `ApplyBeamGateClass::applyToAll()` can easily apply the beam gate at the
   *   right time (the right time is chosen by the implementation of
   *   `simulateAndPlot()`); an `ApplyBeamGateClass` object is obtained with
   *   `makeMyBeamGate()`;
   * * filling of standard plots is performed with `fillAllEfficiencyPlots()`,
   *   `fillEfficiencyPlots()` and `fillEventPlots()`, which can be used as such
   *   or be customized for more plots.
   * 
   * Combination of primitive can be helped with
   * `icarus::trigger::TriggerGateData`
   * 
   * All plots must have already been initialized via `initializePlots()` and
   * its helpers.
   * 
   * The method is required to perform the simulation of the trigger primitives
   * specified in input. These primitives are provided in  `gates` as many
   * collections, one per cryostat. While this interface splits the primitives
   * by cryostat, the trigger simulation gets to choose how to handle that
   * information, e.g. performing an independent simulation per cryostat and
   * then combining them all, or just merging back the two collections and
   * treating the two cryostats as a single entity.
   * 
   * The input trigger primitives are extracted from PMT waveforms with a
   * certain PMT threshold, which is documented by its index `thresholdIndex`;
   * the threshold value can be obtained from `ADCthreshold(thresholdIndex)`,
   * and in the future more information may become available as well.
   * 
   * Plots will need information from the event being simulated: that
   * information is precooked, extracted from the event and stored in
   * `eventInfo`. If more information is needed, `EventInfo_t` needs to be
   * updated in this helper, as no way is provided to perform that customization
   * in the derived class.
   * 
   * It is expected that all PMT thresholds settings identified by the specified
   * index. This helper class does not know the definition of any trigger, and
   * it is expected that settings are tracked by the derived classes and each
   * is associated to an index.

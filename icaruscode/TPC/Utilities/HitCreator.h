   * @brief Class managing the creation of a new `icarus::Hit` object.
   *
   * In order to be as simple as possible (Plain Old Data), data products like
   * `icarus::Hit` need to be stripped of most of their functions, including the
   * ability to communicate whether a value we try to store is invalid
   * (that would require a art::Exception` -- art -- or at least a message on
   * the screen -- MessageFacility) and the ability to read things from event,
   * services (e.g. geometry) etc.
   *
   * A Creator is a class that creates a temporary data product, and at the
   * end it yields it to the caller for storage.
   * This last step should be by move construction, although a copy method is
   * also provided.
   *
   * An example of creating a `icarus::Hit` object (assuming all the relevant
   * variables have been assigned proper values):
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
   * icarus::HitCreator hit(
   *   wire, wireID,
   *   start_tick, end_tick, rms,
   *   peak_time, sigma_peak_time, peak_amplitude, sigma_peak_amplitude,
   *   hit_integral, hit_sigma_integral, summedADC,
   *   multiplicity, local_index, goodness_of_fit, dof
   *   );
   * hit.push_back(hit.move()); // hit content is not valid any more
   * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   *
   * This is a one-step creation object: the hit is constructed at the same
   * time the HitCreator is, and no facility is offered to modify the
   * constructed hit, or to create another one.
   *
   * The constructors currently provided are:
   * 1. from RawDigit (extracts channel, view and signal type [CVS] thanks to
   *    geometry)
   * 2. from `recob::ChannelROI`, [CVS]
   * 3. from `recob::ChannelROI`, [CVS], `summedADC` is automatically computed from
   *      wire
   * 4. from `recob::ChannelROI`, [CVS], start and stop time from a region of interest
   * 5. from `recob::ChannelROI`, [CVS], start and stop time from index of region of
   *      interest

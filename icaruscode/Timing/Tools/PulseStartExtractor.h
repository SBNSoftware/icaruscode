/**
 * @brief Extracts the start time of a pulse from a waveform.
 * 
 * This class implements methods for extracting the start time of reference pulses
 * digitized in PMT special channels. These reference waveforms are expected to exhibit 
 * a negative-polarity square pulse with a sharp rising edge.
 * 
 * The extraction can be performed using either a legacy constant-fraction discrimination (CF)
 * algorithm or a refined logistic function fit.
 * @see icarus::timing::ExtractionMethod for the available methods.
 * 
 * Inputs
 * -------------------------
 * 
 * The extraction method is configured via the constructor by specifying one of the available 
 * methods (defined by the `icarus::timing::ExtractionMethod` enum) and a threshold value.
 * * `method` (`icarus::timing::ExtractionMethod`): specifies the selected method for the
 *    pulse start extraction. The default is `icarus::timing::CONSTANT_FRACTION`.
 * * `threshold` (`double`): detection threshold in ADC counts to avoid selecting noise of 
 *    the reference pulse is missing from its waveform. Default id `500` ADC.
 * 
 * When using a fit method, the initial parameters guesses are determined using the 
 * constant-fraction algorithm to help ensure fit convergence.
 *
 * Signal timing extraction
 * ----------------------------------
 * 
 * The reference waveform is expected to exhibit a negative-polarity square wave.
 * Its selection is performed simply by looking at the absolute minimum of the waveform.
 * A detection threshold on the amplitude is used to exclude picking up spurios signals
 * in case the large square pulse is missing (which could happen for EW/RWM signals).
 * 
 * ### Constant-fraction discrimination
 * 
 * The procedure is the following:
 * * the absolute minimum of the waveform is found;
 * * an interval starting 20 ticks before that minimum is considered and the baseline level
 *   is defined as the value at the start of that interval;
 * * if the baseline-minimum difference is below a threshold, it is assumed to be noise
 *   and the start sample (`0`) is returned; 
 * * within the defined window, the algorithm searches the first sample where the signal
 *   deviates from the baseline by at least 20% of the full amplitude (baseline-minimum difference);
 *   The sample immediately before is returned as the pulse start time.
 * 
 * This algorithm is affected by the 2ns discretization of the input waveforms as there is no 
 * interpolation between the samples.
 * 
 * ### Logistic Fit Method:
 * The pulse rising edge is fitted using a logistic function: `1/(1+exp(([0]-x)/[1]))*[2]+[3]`.
 * The estimate for the pulse start is then taken to be the inflection point (ie. the steepest point,
 * where the first derivative is maximal) which corresponds to parameter `p0`. 
 * It also represents the point at 50% of the amplitude. 
 * 
 * The procedure is the following:
 * * the constant-fraction method is ran first to obtain an initial guess for the pulse 
 *   start time (`p0`). If no signal is found, the start sample (`0`) is returned;
 * * an initial guess for the baseline (`p3`) is estimated as the median of the full waveform;
 * * an initial guess for the amplitude (`p2`) is estimated averaging the first 50 samples
 *   after the initial guess for the rise time (`p0`).
 * * the logistic function fit is performed over a window of `[-25,25]` samples around the
 *   initial guess for the rise time;
 * * if the fit converges, `p0` is returned as the pulse start time;
 * * if the fit fails to converge, multiple retries with slight random variations around the
 *   initial parameters are attempted. If all retries are exahusted, it falls back to
 *   returning the constant-fraction methodâ€™s result.
 *
 * This algorithm allows to interpolate between samples, achieving a better timing resolution.
